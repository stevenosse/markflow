## Tool Name: MarkFlow

## Vision:

MarkFlow aims to be a user-friendly desktop application that simplifies the creation, management, and version control of Markdown documentation. By integrating seamlessly with Git, users can benefit from robust history tracking, collaborative features, and reliable backups for their technical and project documentation.

## Core Features & Plan:

**Phase 1: Local markdown editing & Git Integration (MVP)**

1.  **Project Setup & Onboarding:**
    * **New Project Creation:** Allow users to create new documentation projects. Each project will correspond to a local Git repository.
    * **Clone Existing Repository:** Option to clone an existing Git repository containing Markdown files.
    * **Intuitive Onboarding:** A clear wizard to guide users through initial setup.
2.  **Markdown Editor:**
    * **Dual Pane View:** A live preview pane alongside the Markdown editor (similar to VS Code's Markdown preview).
    * **Rich Editing Experience:** Support for basic Markdown syntax (headings, bold, italics, lists, code blocks, links, images).
    * **Syntax Highlighting:** Enhance readability within the editor.
    * **Auto-Save:** Periodically save changes to avoid data loss.
3.  **Git Integration (Core Functionality):**
    * **Repository Initialization:** Automatically initialize a Git repository when a new project is created.
    * **Staging & Committing:**
        * A clear "Changes" view showing modified/new Markdown files.
        * Simple "Stage All" and "Commit" buttons.
        * Prompt for a commit message.
    * **Push/Pull:** Basic buttons for pushing changes to and pulling changes from a remote repository.
    * **Branching (Basic):** Option to switch between `main`/`master` and potentially create new branches.
    * **History View:** A simplified view of commit history (commit message, author, date). Clicking a commit could show the diff.
4.  **File Management:**
    * **Sidebar Navigation:** A tree-like file explorer to browse and open Markdown files within the project.
    * **New File/Folder Creation:** Ability to create new Markdown files and organize them into folders.
    * **Rename/Delete:** Basic file/folder operations.
5.  **Settings:**
    * **Git User Configuration:** Allow setting Git user name and email.
    * **Default Remote:** Configure the default remote repository URL.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Editor & Git Features**

1.  **Advanced Markdown Editor:**
    * **Table Editor:** Visual aid for creating and editing Markdown tables.
    * **Diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML Integration):** Support for rendering simple diagrams directly in the preview.
    * **Customizable Themes:** Light/dark mode and editor theme options.
    * **Spell Checker:** Integrate a basic spell checker.
2.  **Enhanced Git Functionality:**
    * **Visual Diff Viewer:** Side-by-side or inline diff viewing for file changes between commits.
    * **Revert Changes:** Option to revert specific files or commits.
    * **Branch Management (Advanced):** More robust branch creation, merging, and deletion.
    * **Stashing:** Temporarily save uncommitted changes.
    * **Git Ignore Management:** Simple UI to add/remove entries from `.gitignore`.
3.  **Search & Filtering:**
    * **Content Search:** Search within the Markdown files of the current project.
    * **History Search:** Search commit messages and authors in the history.
4.  **Image Handling:**
    * **Drag-and-Drop Image Upload:** Easily drag images into the editor, and have MarkFlow store them in a designated folder and generate the Markdown link.

**Phase 3: Collaboration & Integrations**

1.  **Remote Repository Management:**
    * **Multiple Remotes:** Support for managing multiple remote repositories.
    * **SSH Key Management:** Simple UI for adding/managing SSH keys for Git authentication.
2.  **Template System:**
    * **Reusable Document Templates:** Allow users to create and apply templates for common document structures.
3.  **Export Options:**
    * **PDF Export:** Export Markdown documents to PDF.
    * **HTML Export:** Export Markdown to HTML.
4.  **Cross-Platform Sync (Future Consideration):**
    * While Git inherently provides syncing, consider features like "Open Project in new window" for quick access across different machines if local cloning is already handled.
5.  **Plugin Architecture (Long-term):**
    * Allow community-driven plugins for extended functionality (e.g., custom linters, integrations with specific documentation platforms).

## Technology stack:

* **Frontend Framework:** Flutter (for cross-platform desktop application)
* **Markdown Parsing/Rendering:** A suitable Dart/Flutter Markdown library (e.g., `flutter_markdown`).
* **Git Integration:** Utilize a Dart/Flutter library for Git operations (e.g., `git_fvm` or directly interact with the Git command-line interface via `dart:io` if a robust library isn't available, carefully handling security and error cases).
* **State Management:** Homemade
* **Local Storage:** `shared_preferences` for application settings, and direct file system access for project files.

## Monetization (Optional - Future Consideration):

* **Premium Features:** Advanced Git history visualization, specific integrations, or custom templates.
* **Enterprise Licensing:** For larger teams requiring specific support or features.

## Marketing & Distribution:

* **Website/Landing Page:** Showcase features, provide download links.
* **App Stores:** Distribute via macOS App Store, Microsoft Store, and potentially Linux snap/flatpak.
* **Open Source (Partial/Full):** Consider making parts or the entire project open-source to foster community contributions and trust.

This plan provides a structured approach to developing MarkFlow, starting with core functionalities and gradually adding more advanced features. The Flutter framework will allow for a consistent and performant user experience across different desktop operating systems.
